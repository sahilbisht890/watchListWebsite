### **Movie Watchlist Application**  

The Movie Watchlist Application is a dynamic and interactive platform designed to help users explore movies and organize their watchlists efficiently.  

#### **Key Features**  

1. **Movie Search and Details View**  
   - Users can search for their favorite movies using a search bar.  
   - Upon selecting a movie, a detailed view provides comprehensive information about the movie, such as its title, release date, synopsis, genre, and ratings.  

2. **User Authentication**  
   - Users can log in securely using their email.  
   - Authentication enables personalized experiences, such as maintaining unique watchlists for each user.  

3. **Watchlist Management**  
   - Users can create multiple watchlists based on their preferences (e.g., "Action Movies," "Weekend Picks").  
   - Each movie can be added to one or more watchlists, allowing for easy organization.  

4. **Sidebar Navigation**  
   - The sidebar displays a list of all the watchlists the user has created.  
   - This ensures quick navigation between different watchlists.  

5. **Watchlist Filtering**
